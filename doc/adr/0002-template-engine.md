# Choose template engine

## Status
Deliberating

## Context
I need to convert some .md files to HTML. Looking into libs that could do that.

### Options
- #### [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup)
- #### [Selmer](https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer)
- #### [Enlive](https://github.com/cgrand/enlive)
- #### [Stencil](https://github.com/davidsantiago/stencil)


## Decision
I went with Selmer since it's HTML and it looks like it can be easily integrated with some
markdown to HTML lib.
